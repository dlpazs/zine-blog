Imagine two sheets of colored paper: \r\n                one red and one blue. Put one on top of the other. Now crumple them together into a small \r\n                ball. That crumpled paper ball is your input data, and each sheet of paper is a class of \r\n                data in a classification problem. What a neural network (or any other machine-learning model) \r\n                is meant to do is figure out a transformation of the paper ball that would uncrumple it, so \r\n                as to make the two classes cleanly separable again. With deep learning, this would be \r\n                implemented as a series of simple transformations of the 3D space, such as those you could \r\n                apply on the paper ball with your fingers, one movement at a time. \r\n\r\n                Uncrumpling paper balls is what machine learning is about: finding neat representations \r\n                for complex, highly folded data manifolds. At this point, you should have a pretty good \r\n                intuition as to why deep learning excels at this: it takes the approach of incrementally \r\n                decomposing a complicated geometric transformation into a long chain of elementary ones, \r\n                which is pretty much the strategy a human would follow to uncrumple a paper ball. \r\n                Each layer in a deep network applies a transformation that disentangles the data a \r\n                little - and a deep stack of layers makes tractable an extremely complicated \r\n                disentanglement process.\r\n\r\n                Deep Learning with Python page 44–5.\r\n                </blockquote>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Cnn_zine","import React from 'react';\nimport logo from './logo.svg';\nimport './App.css';\nimport { Route, Link, BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport Cnn_zine from \"./components/cnn/cnn.zine\"\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <h1>My Personal Blog</h1>\n        </div>\n        <Route exact path=\"/\" component={App}></Route>\n        <Route exact path=\"/cnns\" component={Cnn_zine}></Route>\n        <Link to=\"/\">Home</Link>\n        <Link to=\"/cnns\">Everybody love's CNN's</Link>\n      </div>\n    </Router>\n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
