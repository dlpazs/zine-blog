Imagine two sheets of colored paper: one red and one blue. Put one on top of the other. Now crumple them together into a small ball. That crumpled paper ball is your input data, and each sheet of paper is a class of data in a classification problem. What a neural network (or any other machine-learning model) is meant to do is figure out a transformation of the paper ball that would uncrumple it, so as to make the two classes cleanly separable again. With deep learning, this would be implemented as a series of simple transformations of the 3D space, such as those you could apply on the paper ball with your fingers, one movement at a time.\xa0 Uncrumpling paper balls is what machine learning is about: finding neat representations for complex, highly folded data manifolds. At this point, you should have a pretty good intuition as to why deep learning excels at this: it takes the approach of incrementally decomposing a complicated geometric transformation into a long chain of elementary ones, which is pretty much the strategy a human would follow to uncrumple a paper ball. Each layer in a deep network applies a transformation that disentangles the data a little\u200a-\u200aand a deep stack of layers makes tractable an extremely complicated disentanglement process. Deep Learning with Python page 44\u20135."),o.a.createElement("blockquote",null,"Conv layers look at spatially local patterns by applying the same geometric transformation to different spatial locations (patches) in an input tensor. This results in a representation that are translation invariant (does not matter where in the image the object occurs). Convnets consist of stacks of convolution and max-pooling layers. The pooling layers let you spatially downsample the data, which is required to keep feature maps to a reasonable size as the number of features grows, and to allow subsequent convolution layers to see a greater spatial extent of the inputs. Convnets are often ended with a `Flatten` operation or global pooling layer, turning spatial feature maps into vectors, followed by `Dense` layers to achieve classification or regression."))}}]),t}(n.Component),f=a(22),g=function(){return o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("h1",null,"Home"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"With some content"))},b=function(e){var t=e.match;return o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("h2",null,"Current Route"),o.a.createElement("div",null,"".concat(t.params.topicId)))},y=function(e){var t=e.match;return o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("h1",null,"Topics"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Choose a topic"),o.a.createElement("ul",null,o.a.createElement("li",null,o.a.createElement(i.b,{to:"".concat(t.url,"/limitations")},"Limitations")),o.a.createElement("li",null,o.a.createElement(i.b,{to:"".concat(t.url,"/batch_norm")},"Batch Norm"))),o.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"".concat(t.url,"/:topicId"),component:b}))},E={background:"#000",width:"2px",cursor:"col-resize",margin:"0 5px",height:"100%"};var v=function(){return o.a.createElement(i.a,null,o.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},o.a.createElement(f.a,{split:"vertical",minSize:100,defaultSize:100,resizerStyle:E},o.a.createElement("menu",null,o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement(i.b,{to:"/zine-blog"},"Home")),o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement(i.b,{to:"/topics"},"Topics")),o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement(i.b,{to:"/cnns"},"CNNs"))),o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/zine-blog",component:g}),o.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/topics",component:y}),o.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/cnns",component:d})))))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(o.a.createElement(v,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()}))}},[[24,1,2]]]);
